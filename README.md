# ORN1
Single-cell RNA-seq for Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons from the mid-pupal stage antenna (Li et al., 2020)


This repository holds code for analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data from Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs).


# Organization

Code for visualization and analysis, including reproducing figures shown in the paper, is in the analysis directory.

Preprocessed sequence data and various intermediate files used during analysis are in the data directory.

Raw sequence data can be obtained from the Sequence Read Archive (accession GSE143038).


# Iterative Clustering for Identifying Markers (ICIM)
